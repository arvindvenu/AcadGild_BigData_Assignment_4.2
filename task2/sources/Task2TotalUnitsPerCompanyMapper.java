	 * This method takes as input key and value. The input key and value are 
	 * determined by the InputFormat class defined in the job driver. Since in this 
	 * case it is a TextInputFormat, the input key type will be LongWritable(offset of 
	 * the line from the beginning of the file) and iput value type will be of Text(the 
	 * actual contents of the line). Various fields in a particular line are separated by 
	 * pipe(|). In every line first field is company name. So splitting by pipe and checking 
	 * if the first and second field are not equal to NA. Only if they are not NA. 
	 * they will be output by the mapper,thereby filtering the records in the input file. 
	 * We have to calculate the number of units sold by each company. So companyName 
	 * has to be the key output by the mapper.And each line in the input represents 
	 * one unit sold. Therefore the value will be 1
